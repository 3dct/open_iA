//! Interface for anything that can be saved as a project.
//! Necessary since not all current tools employ mdichild as container for their widgets.
//! So every such container needs to implement this class and its doLoadProject method,
//! in order to be called when the user selects to "Save Project".
//!
//! Refactoring ideas:
//! - make this class the container for the open projects currently stored in
//!   MdiChild::m_projects,
//!   and move MdiChild::doSaveProject into saveProject (or into default implementation of
//!   doSaveProject, as MdiChild probably into the forseeable future needs to do things
//!   differently to be able to load .mod files)
//! - rename to iAOpenProjects or something?
